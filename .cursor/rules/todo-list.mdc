# TODO List Execution Rule

- All development, implementation, and progress tracking for this project must strictly follow the tasks and phases defined in [todo-list.md](mdc:prompts/todo-list.md).
- No new features, refactors, or documentation changes should be made unless they are explicitly listed in the TODO list, or the TODO list is updated accordingly.
- All progress, completed tasks, and blockers must be recorded and updated in the TODO list document.
- This rule ensures transparency, traceability, and disciplined project management.
