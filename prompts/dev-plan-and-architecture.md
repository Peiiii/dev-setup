# Development Plan & Technical Architecture

## 1. Development Roadmap (Milestones)

### Phase 1: Core Automation & CLI MVP
- [x] Atomic setup scripts for frontend (Homebrew, nvm, Node.js, VSCode, etc.)
- [x] Interactive CLI (collection/step selection)
- [x] Docker-based testing for scripts
- [x] English-only output and documentation
- [ ] Modularize for future collections (backend, AI, etc.)

### Phase 2: Documentation & Best Practices
- [ ] Curated setup guides for MacBook development
- [ ] Best practices for security, performance, and productivity
- [ ] Application/tool recommendations (with install scripts/links)

### Phase 3: Web Application Prototype
- [ ] Web UI for visual setup selection and progress tracking
- [ ] User profile and setup history management
- [ ] Community sharing of custom setup collections

### Phase 4: Extensibility & Open Source Ecosystem
- [ ] Plugin system for custom scripts and collections
- [ ] Cloud sync and backup integration
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) support

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview

### Core Modules
- **Setup Engine**: Executes atomic scripts, manages dependencies, supports both CLI and Web triggers
- **CLI Interface**: Node.js + inquirer, interactive selection and feedback
- **Script Collections**: Directory-based, modular, easy to extend
- **Documentation System**: Markdown-based guides, best practices, and recommendations
- **Web Application (future)**: React/Next.js (or similar), REST API backend, user management, real-time progress

### Technology Stack
- **Shell Scripts**: Bash (atomic setup steps)
- **Node.js**: CLI logic, script orchestration
- **inquirer**: CLI interaction
- **Docker**: Environment isolation and testing
- **Markdown**: Documentation and guides
- **Web UI (future)**: React/Next.js, RESTful API (Node.js/Express or similar)
- **Cloud (future)**: Integration with cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive)

### Extensibility & Best Practices
- All scripts and docs in English for global collaboration
- Modular directory structure for easy addition of new setup collections
- Open source contribution guidelines and plugin system
- Automated testing (Docker, CI/CD integration)
